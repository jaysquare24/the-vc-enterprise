# The VC Experience

The VC Experience is a responsive business portfolio website designed to showcase the mission, portfolio, team, and contact information of a venture capital enterprise. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design and interactivity.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Navigation**: A collapsible menu is implemented for smaller screens, allowing users to toggle the navigation bar.
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Displays a collection of companies in the mobility sector with images and descriptions.
- **Team Section**: Highlights key members of the investment team with photos and roles.
- **Contact Information**: Provides contact details for the enterprise.

## File Structure

### `index.html`

The main HTML file contains the structure of the website, including the header, main content sections (mission, portfolio, team), and footer.

### `style.css`

The CSS file defines the styling for the website, including layout, typography, and responsive design using media queries.

### `script.js`

The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the website, such as toggling the navigation menu on smaller screens.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Explore the website and its features.

## Responsive Design

The website uses media queries to adapt to smaller screens. On devices with a width of 460px or less:
- The main navigation bar is hidden.
- A collapsible menu is displayed for easier navigation.
- Images and layouts are adjusted for better readability.

## Interactivity

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) includes the following functionality:
- **Menu Toggle**: Clicking the "Menu" link toggles the visibility of the navigation bar.
- **Auto-Close Navigation**: Clicking on any navigation link in the collapsible menu automatically hides the menu.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity.

## Future Enhancements

- Add animations for smoother transitions when toggling the menu.
- Include additional sections, such as testimonials or a blog.
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA roles and attributes.
